# Angular + Tailwind Template

You can fork this template if you need a basic setup for an Angular project and want to use Tailwind CSS for the UI.
Tailwind was integrated according to this [guide](https://jacobneterer.medium.com/angular-and-tailwindcss-2388fb6e0bab).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Tailwind components

You will find some designed components at [tailwindui.com](https://tailwindui.com/). Just copy the HTML code into your components .html file.

# Angular + Tailwind Template

You can fork this template if you need a basic setup for an Angular project and want to use Tailwind CSS for the UI.
Tailwind was integrated according to this [guide](https://jacobneterer.medium.com/angular-and-tailwindcss-2388fb6e0bab).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. If the website looks like the screenshot in "src/assets/img", Tailwind is set up and you can start coding.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Tailwind components

You will find some designed components at [tailwindui.com](https://tailwindui.com/). Just copy the HTML code into your components .html file.

## i18n

This project uses ngx-translate to enable the translation into different language. It was set up by following this [guide](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit/tutorials/how-to-translate-your-angular-app-with-ngx-translate). You can add new language files in "src/assets/i18n".

## NgRX

This project uses NgRx functionality to keep a good overview of the state. It was set up by following this [guide](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/install) and can be used accordingly.
